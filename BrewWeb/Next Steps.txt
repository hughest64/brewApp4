- create a view to select a recipe - CHECK

- add href to time view to go there - CHECK
  - add to layout.html? (I'm thinking a "menu bar" type thing would be good).
    That menu bar would be accesible in all views.

- populate the contents of a recipe directory - CHECK
  - form with radio buttons

- save button submits data to save view
  - add action to go to url_for save with post action on the form - CHECK
  - use selected recipe as input for save method in python
  - that will set your tree.root for xml parsing
  - load all of the appropriate information into and extension
    for use in timer.html
- use submitted data from save view to:
  - lists of mash and boils steps are populated
  - a label for the recipe name is populated
  - a timer is set for the first mash step
  - a label for the step name is populated

- at the end of each timer, the next timer is automatically set

- add functionality to "upload" files to the recipes diretory
