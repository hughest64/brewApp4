some todo:
timer step concerns:
- need to reset index when selecting a new recipe,
  but no page refresh of the same recipe.
- what happens when we set a manual timer after a recipe has been selected?


- use submitted data from save view to:
- add functionality to "upload" files to the recipes directory

- clean up app.py (doc strings!?!)
