I'd like to track a brew start to finish in the app.
Including:
- list of  all ingredients and amounts
  - water, grain, hops, yeast, other additions
pH on brew day
  - sparge, strike, mash, boil, etc
- track gravity throughout
- monitor and control temps on brew display

I'd like to be able to store all of this locally for easy access
as well as write it back to xml/bsmx/Google sheets.
And make some awesome charts for each brew
