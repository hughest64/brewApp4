I'd like to track a brew start to finish in the app.
Including:
- list of  all ingredients and amounts
  - water, grain, hops, yeast, other additions
pH on brew day
  - sparge, strike, mash, boil, etc
- track gravity throughout
- monitor and control temps on brew day
- have brewing calculators
- chart mash temp in real time
- be able to modify/update bsmx files on the fly with hops changes, etc.

I'd like to be able to store all of this locally for easy access
as well as write it back to xml/bsmx/Google sheets.
And make some awesome charts for each brew
